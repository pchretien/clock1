Abstract Clock (clock1)
=======================

Minimalist abstract clock using a RaspberryPi and stepper motors. The minutes hand is in wood and the hours are marked by a steel ball rolling on top of the whooden hand. The steel ball is driven by a moving rare-earth magnet hidden in the body of the hand.
